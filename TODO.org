* Todo [0/4]:
 - [ ] Add a commandline that allows you to assemble the mech
 - [ ] Allow networks of cabling, with tree structure, rather than point to point
 - [ ] Respect bandwidth limitations of cables etc
 - [ ] Enforce that cabling can't be connected while physical attachment is active
 - [ ] Have a broadcast level that you attach terminal to [0/4]
   - [ ] All cable attachments etc would broadcast here
   - [ ] All broadcasts of errors or overloads happen here
   - [ ] Must attach to things that you want messages from, unless
     they are already connected to the broadcast port of something you
     are attached to already.
   - [ ] Must disconnect the diagnostic computer from the mech before moving it
 - [ ] Add damage per component.
 - [ ] Attachments that exceed weight tolerance become damaged or unuseable
 - [ ] Be able to repair physical components (this may be long term)
 - [ ] Need a concept of "free-standing" vs. supported when
   determining if an attachment is under weight tolerances
 - [ ] ensure that broadcasts over a bus aren't duplicated by determining the connected components
